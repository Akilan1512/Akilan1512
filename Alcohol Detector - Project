AIM:
The "Alcohol Detector" project aims to develop a microcontroller-based system capable of accurately detecting alcohol vapors and LPG gas in the surrounding environment. 
This project addresses the risks associated with alcohol abuse and potential LPG gas leaks in homes. By providing a reliable and cost-effective solution for monitoring 
these concentrations, the project seeks to enhance safety and prevent hazards in domestic environments.

COMPONENTS USED:
The "Alcohol Detector" project utilizes the following components:
- 8051 Microcontroller Kit: Acts as the central processing unit for data handling and control.
- MQ-3 Gas Sensor (Alcohol and LPG): Detects changes in resistance when exposed to alcohol vapors and LPG gas.
- LM2596 Step-Down Converter: Ensures stable voltage supply to the system.
- 7.4V Battery Source: Provides power to the system.
- Switch for Circuit Control: Enables manual control of the circuit.
- LCD Display: Provides visual feedback by displaying messages/alerts.

THEORY:
The system operates based on the principle of the MQ-3 gas sensor, which exhibits a change in resistance in the presence of alcohol vapors and LPG gas. When alcohol or 
LPG gas is detected, the sensor's resistance changes, and this data is sent to the 8051 microcontroller for processing. The LM2596 step-down converter ensures a stable 
and regulated power supply to the system. The LCD display serves as an output interface to provide real-time feedback to the user. 

ALGORITHM AND PROCESS INVOLVED:
The algorithm for the "Alcohol Detector" project follows these steps: 
1. Initialize the system and sensor.
2. Read sensor data for alcohol and LPG gas concentrations.
3. Process data using the 8051 microcontroller.
4. Compare alcohol and LPG gas concentrations with predefined thresholds.
5. If either concentration exceeds thresholds, trigger an alert.
6. Display "Alcohol Detected" on the LCD display when alcohol is detected.
